This is the project of team UNO participated in 2017 Thales Project Arduino competition in Tongji University. The design is "Railway Intrusion Detection System". We realized the combination of sensors (human infrared sensors, micro-motion sensors, etc.), communication module (GPRS modules) and microcontrollers to form a system with intelligent detection, provided a solution in railway safety.
